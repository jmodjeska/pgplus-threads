# Format of this file: description<nl>variable<nl>helptext<nl><nl>.
# If the question being documented is of type "choice", we list
# only the first occurring config variable. The help texts
# must not contain empty lines. No variable should occur twice; if it
# does, only the first occurrence will be used by Configure. The lines
# in a help text should be indented two positions. Lines starting with
# `#' are ignored. To be nice to menuconfig, limit your lines to 70
# characters. Use emacs' kfill.el to edit this file or you lose.

Root directory
ROOT
  The path to the talker directory. This *MUST* end with a trailing /
  and will probably be something like "/home/yourid/pgplus/". If you
  get this wrong nothing horrible will happen - except your talker
  won't boot.

Use Spires new process_output (beta)
NEW_PROCESS_OUTPUT
  Use the new process_output function written by Spire for Playground
  talkers. This is generally faster, leaner and prettier than the
  original code but has the disadvantage of not being tested as much.
  All bug reports for this code should be mailed to <pre@pre.org>.

Include intercom server support
INTERCOM
  Includes Grim's intercom code which allows you to talker to other
  people on other talkers without leaving your own.
  PLEASE NOTE: Although this has been tested to see if it works I
  (Silver) am not responsible for maintaining the code so any
  problems shouldn't be blamed on Playground+ :o)

Include Crash recovery code
ANTICRASH
  This includes some code that attempts to trap errors when they
  occur and stop the talker from crashing down.  You will see messages
  on the screen when a recoverable error is saved.

Number of crashes until program exits
MAX_CRASH
  This sets how many times the program will recover from a small crash
  before it decides to exit and reboot.  It's useful to set this to
  something reasonable (say 5) so you don't end up with it getting
  stuck into a fast crash/recover loop.

Include auto-shutdown code
AUTOSHUTDOWN
  Allows the staff to set the talker so that it will automatically
  perform a full shutdown and reboot when there is no-one logged on.

Include robots code
ROBOTS
  Include Slaine's robots code which allows the creation of computer
  controlled residents which can perform a variety of commands as
  defined in a text file.
  PLEASE NOTE: Although this has been tested to see if it works I
  (Silver) am not responsible for maintaining the code so any problems
  shouldn't be blamed on Playground+ :o)

Include Segtor's IntelliBots (early beta)
INTELLIBOTS
  Include Segtor's Intelligent Robots code that allows Slaine's
  robots to be triggered by different trigger phrases.
  PLEASE NOTE: To actually use these intelligent robots, you have
  to edit the file robot_int.c to set them up.

Include last people login tracing
LAST
  Enable the "viewlast" command which allows residents to see who was
  lasted logged in, what time and how long they stayed around for.

Number of connections kept
LAST_SHOW
  The number of people stored in the last login database.

Include command stats code
COMMAND_STATS
  Enable users to see which commands are the most frequently used.
  Novelty value only.

Use new pager code
NEWPAGER
  Use Nightwolf's new pager code which allows you to use commands
  whilst still in the pager.

Allow seamless rebooting of talker
SEAMLESS_REBOOT
  Include phypor's seamless reboot code which allows you to reboot the
  talker "on the fly". that is, without having to kick all the
  residents off. Definitely recommended.

Enable partial command matching code
COM_MATCH
  Enables code which will attempt to partially match commands
  (i.e., if you type "boun" then the "bounce" command will be used).

Include ident server lookup code
IDENT
  Allows the admin to see what account name a user is connecting with
  provided the server they are connecting from uses an ident server.

Number of lines of SU history
SUH_NUM
  The number of items recorded by Astyanax's SU history code ("suh").
  A good value is between 10 and 30.

Use new residency proposal code
NEW_RES_CODE
  Selecting this option will mean that the "res" command proposes a
  newbie for residency and gives the rest of the staff one minute to
  object (using the "obj" command) if they so wish before the newbie
  becomes a resident. If you don't like the idea then selecting "N"
  will use the standard PG96 style residency system.

Enable multis (chains) for group communication
ALLOW_MULTIS
  If enabled will assign a number to any communication command (e.g.,
  tell, remote, rsing, tf etc) which can then be used in the way you
  would normally converse with one person. If you don't understand
  then enable it and have a play around with "tf" and multiple tells.

Use new reconnection code
NEW_RECONNECT
  Use phypor's new reconnection code. There is no need to use the old
  code unless you have hacked it about a lot.

Enable function backtrace in dump log (linux only)
USE_BACKTRACE
  Enables function backtracing so that the dump log shows what
  functions were called before the talker crashed. Works on Linux
  only.

Timeout for news articles
NEWS_TIMEOUT
  How long (in seconds) before news articles are deleted

Timeout for mail articles
MAIL_TIMEOUT
  How long (in seconds) before peoples mails are deleted

Maximum log size
MAX_LOG_SIZE
  How big the logs can be before getting trimmed.
  NOTE: Thanks to phypor's fifo log code they are not deleted like
  PG96 used to do.

Enable threading
THREADS
  Enable threaded commands. This will not affect existing commands
  in PG+, only new commands that you add that take advantage of
  the functionality in threads.c.

Max threads
MAX_THREADS
  Threads are used for custom system commands. How many simultaneous
  threads should be allowed depends on how many threaded commands are
  available and how many people use them. Consider increasing if
  you're seeing "Couldn't add threaded task" errors.
